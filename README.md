# SkillDevelopment

This is my 3rd JS project to build my skill on Javascript.
Its a calcultor that uses only minor expressions and calculates bounded values.
The main thing that I havenot done in this project is that I couldnot maintain the CSS. 
When I feel like I have learned many more about JS then I will go for the CSS for all of my previous and upcoming projects.
